        &emsp;Hello, and welcome to my portfolio site! I'm Christopher Venczel, a programmer and web developer interested in data visualization and analysis. This website is a portfolio of some of the interactive Javascript projects I have created using the <a class="basicLink" target="_blank" href="https://p5js.org/">P5JS</a> library.
        </p>
        
        <p id="p2">
        &emsp;The projects feature a variety of different things that interest me including Music 🎵, Design 🎨, Math 📈, Physics 🚀, and AI 🧠.
        The code for the projects as well as for the website is open-source under the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit" class="basicLink" target="_blank">MIT Licence</a> and can be found on my GitHub 
        <a target="_blank" class="basicLink" href="https://github.com/chrisvenczel/PortfolioWebsite">here</a>.
