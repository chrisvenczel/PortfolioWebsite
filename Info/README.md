# PortfolioWebsite

This is the code for my interactive portfolio website. It includes the HTML, CSS, PHP etc as well as the projects themselves written in P5JS.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.0+ CLI (for the built-in web server)
- Node 18+ (for npm scripts)

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (no extra packages are pulled; this just enables the scripts).
2. Start the site: `npm start`.
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the server.

## Hosting on your network

- Use `npm run start:host` to bind to `0.0.0.0:8000` so other devices on the network can view the site (ensure firewall rules allow it).
